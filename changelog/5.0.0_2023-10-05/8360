Enhancement: Change how all files deleted is handled

When the client detects that all files are deleted on either side of the sync,
the client now aborts the sync and asks for a user decision.
Afterwords a new sync is started.

Previously we blocked the current sync until the user responded which could lead to unwanted side effects.
