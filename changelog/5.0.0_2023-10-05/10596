Enhancement: Allow selective sync of spaces in folder wizard

When manually configuring the synchronization of spaces, we now show the
selective sync page again to allow users to selectively disable the
synchronization of remote directories.

This prevents the unnecessary synchronization of files until the user can use
the account settings dialog to configure selective sync.
