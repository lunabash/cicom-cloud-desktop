Enhancement: (Re)introduce "sync hidden files" parameter in owncloudcmd

There used to be an option to enable the synchronization of hidden files using the -h parameter which collided with the --help option and subsequently was removed.
A new --sync-hidden-files parameter was introduced to fill in the missing feature.
