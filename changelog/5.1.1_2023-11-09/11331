Bugfix: Prevent permanent deletion of files when disabling VFS

When a user disabled the virtual files feature on Windows, all currently dehydrated files were deleted accidentally.
On the server those files where still available in the trash bin.
This regression was introduced in the previous release 5.0.0.
