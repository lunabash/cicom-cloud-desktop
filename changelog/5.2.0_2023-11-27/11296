Bugfix: Fix url resolution for app provider

We fixed a bug in the url resolution for the app provider.
If owncloud is installed to a non root directory we computed a wrong url for the app provider urls.
This could trigger a connection validation in the client, which intern triggered a request to the app provider.
Reulting in an endless loop rendering the client unusable.
